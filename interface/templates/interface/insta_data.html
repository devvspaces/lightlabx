                        <p>PixelPeeper.io can reverse-engineer edits from photos, but it needs JPGs with metadata. Instagram strips metadata from files, but there are work-arounds you can try.</p>
                        <p>Photos downloaded directly from Instagram won't work with PixelPeeper, because they don't contain metadata. Instagram strips it to save up on bandwidth (metadata makes files bigger).</p>
                        <p>There are also privacy concerns: photos taken on phones can contain the exact location they were taken at. If they didn't remove it, you can only imagine what stalkers could use it for.</p>
                        <p>So, there's no way to get metadata directly from Instagram, but if the author has a website, there's a chance they upload the same photos there as well â€” and you have a much bigger chance finding original photos with metadata on their website.</p>
